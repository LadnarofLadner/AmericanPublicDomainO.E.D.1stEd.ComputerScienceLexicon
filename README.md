GOAL : Production of an Open-Source, Public Domain, 1st Edition Oxford English Dictionary, "page-ified" (paginated?), "lex-ified" (lexicon-ized?), for computer science, APIs, speech generation, speech recognition, A.I. and etc.

(DISCLAIMER: I clicked GNU 3.0 GPL, and almost chose MIT license for this project, but after reading a bit more about the differences, I am leaning towards a re-launch of this project under "The Unlicense". In short, Copyleft principles should abound for this project, as the English language clearly belongs to all of us. I apologize for my initial neglect of--and reflexive and impetuous disregard for-- the legal particulars.)

OK, just last week, or in the previous week, or two (or five?), I asked Google-A.I. if there was a legitimate place to get a scanned copy of the Oxford English Dictionary. Not that I am squeamish about illegitimate places to acquire scanned texts (as that seems to be the primary mode for the communication of intelligent ideas, these days! Illegitimately!!), but, I figured if I was to make it into a lexicon, similar to the CMU dictionary I already knew of, I would need something that was relatively permissive, especially if I wanted it to be open-source, to be shared, in the best of Linux, UNIX (Eunuchs!), FSF, and FOSS ethical traditions.

Some years ago, while fiddling with a "speakjet" speech chip, and then, later, with a Linux program called "festival" (see Allan Balck's work, at Edinburgh and Carnegie-Mellon; see also, Feast-Vox, and Sphinx; and the unassociated espeak, and similar open-source speech phoneme concatenators), I happened upon the CMU-dict, a list of approx. 134,000 pronouncable, machine-pronouncable, dictionary entries, utilizing phoneemes, and ARPABET binary codes (I will note, here, that all versions of CMU-dict up to version 0.6-0.7 are public domain, with versions after about 1998-2014? adopting a 2-clause BSD license).

So, I waste da bit of time on internet arch9ive downlaoding some very over-sized files (about 42 GB worhth!) but paiod little attention to the licenses or copyrights. i simply assumed the internetr archive had sorted that peart out, btu I will not assume that. I asked GoogleA.I., again, if any O.E.D. was inty eh opublic domain. Go9o9gle answere3d, yes, in the USA, the 1st edition printing is defintiely in the public domain, as of 2024. It is most certainly 2025, so I care not what month or date. We seem to be in legal and legitimate territory, ehre.

And sio, my next question to Google-A.I. was " Wherre can I get pdf copies of the dfirst edition, the one that is in the public domain?". GFio9gle resopionede3d witha  fine link to a UPENN website, which, incidentally, just linked to particular violumes on the internet archive.

It is also worth noting here, that, I f one
