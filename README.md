# AmericanPublicDomainO.E.D.1stEd.ComputerScienceLexicon


GOAL : Production of an Open-Source, Public Domain, 1st Edition Oxford English Dictionary, "page-ified" (paginated?), "lex-ified" (lexicon-ized?), for computer science, APIs, speech generation, speech recognition, A.I. and etc.

(DISCLAIMER: I clicked GNU 3.0 GPL, and almost chose MIT license for this project, but after reading a bit more about the differences, I am leaning towards a re-launch of this project under "The Unlicense". In short, Copyleft principles should abound for this project, as the English language clearly belongs to all of us. I apologize for my initial neglect of--and reflexive and impetuous disregard for-- the legal particulars.)

OK, just last week, or in the previous week, or two (or five?), I asked Google-A.I. if there was a legitimate place to get a scanned copy of the Oxford English Dictionary. Not that I am squeamish about illegitimate places to acquire scanned texts (as that seems to be the primary mode for the communication of intelligent ideas, these days! Illegitimately!!), but, I figured if I was to make it into a lexicon, similar to the CMU dictionary I already knew of, I would need something that was relatively permissive, especially if I wanted it to be open-source, to be shared, in the best of Linux, UNIX (Eunuchs!), FSF, and FOSS ethical traditions.

Some years ago, while fiddling with a "speakjet" speech chip, and then, later, with a Linux program called "festival" (see Alan Black's work, at Edinburgh and Carnegie-Mellon; see also, Fest-Vox, and Sphinx; and the unassociated espeak, and similar open-source, speech phoneme concatenators), I happened upon the CMU-dict, a digitized list of approx. 134,000 pronounceable, machine-pronounceable, dictionary entries, utilizing phonemes, IPA, and ARPABET binary codes (I will note, here, that all versions of CMU-dict up to version 0.6-0.7 are and were in the public domain, with versions after about 1998-2014? adopting a 2-clause BSD license).

So, I wasted a bit of time on the internet archive downloading some very over-sized files (15 files, pdfs, about 42 GB worth! The "text-fied" files listed next to these pdfs were barely Megabytes, or 10s of MB, if I recall correctly.) but I paid little attention to the licenses or copyrights, or even print or copyright dates. I simply assumed the internet archive had sorted that part out, but I reconsidered this, when I decided that this project should occur here, on Github, and that this project should include other people; I  will not assume those files are free to use in this project.

So, I then asked Google-A.I., again, if any O.E.D. was in the public domain. Google answered, yes, in the USA, the 1st edition printing is defintiely in the public domain, as of 2024. It is most certainly 2025, now, so I care not what month or date of 2024 it entered public domain. We seem to be in legal and legitimate territory, here.

And so, my next question to Google-A.I. was "Where can I get pdf copies of the 1st Ed. O.E.D., the one that is in the public domain?". Google responded with a fine link to a UPENN website, which, incidentally, just linked to the 15 particular files (10 volumes, I-X) on the internet archive. These volunmes were, luckily, more compact, coming in at about 4 GB. Here is the link, as well as two others that might prove useful to us, in this project ( (1) https://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/webbin/metabook?id=newenglishdictionary (2) https://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/search.html (3) https://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/webbin/book/search?author=&amode=words&title=Oxford+English+Dictionary&tmode=words&c=x ).

It is also worth noting here, that, if one needs metadata files associated with these pdfs, the internet archive offers about 127 didffferent types, in the klinks that the UPENN "Online Books" website poibnts to. (The ealrier, alrger files I had downloaded, at 42 GB, I had actually taken 30 fikles, two of each, labelled "pdf" and "pdf+txt"). But the item linked to by UPENN did not have an entry for "pdf+txt". The 15 links tended to have about 17 didfferent options fopr different kinds of metadfata.

SANDBOX: FIX THIS PARAGRAPH LATER : 

The Linux utilities pdfseparate and pdfunite are provided by the Poppler utilities package, which is free and open-source software. 

The Poppler utilities are primarily licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL). Specifically, this includes GPL-2.0-only, GPL-3.0-or-later, LGPL-2.0-or-later, LGPL-2.1-or-later, MIT, and HPND-sell-variant licenses. 

This means you are generally free to use, distribute, and modify pdfseparate and pdfunite, as long as you adhere to the terms of the chosen GPL version.

Google-A.I. does not seem to think that this license would limit distirbution or modification fo the separated or combined files, after use of the pdfseparate and pdunite "poppler" utilities. I will assume that the files, once split apart into individual IO.E.D. 1st edition pages, are as frewe to sue an d utilize and modifiy as the original total fiels were. i will also assume that other imaging sioftware that we use to fruther process these files place no trestircitons on end use of our data. I wil do SOME due diligience, to make certain I am using copyleft softwware with permsissive rights, but I will not be taking on the role of lawyer here. Somwe of the softawre I / We need in this project must be written from scratch, or preferebly will eb written from scratch, so it is probabkly a moot point.
