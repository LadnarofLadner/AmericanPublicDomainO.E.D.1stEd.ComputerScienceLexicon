Randall Meyer, Evolution Biologist "Extraordinaire", Hilo, Hawaii; July 15, 2025:

OK, just last week, or in the previous week, or two (or five?), I asked Google-A.I. if there was a legitimate place to get a scanned copy of the Oxford English Dictionary. Not that I am squeamish about illegitimate places to acquire scanned texts (as that seems to be the primary mode of communication of intelligent ideas, these days! Illegitimately!!), but, I figured if I was to make it into a lexicon, like the CMU dictionary I knew of, I would need something that was relatively permissive, especially if I wanted it to be open-source, to be shared, in the best of Linux, UNIX (Eunuchs!), FSF, and FOSS ethical traditions.

Some years ago, while fiddling with a "speakjet" speech chip, and then, later, with a Linux program called "festival" (see Allan Balck's work, at Edinburgh and Carnegie-Mellon; see also, Feast-Vox, and Sphinx; and the unassociated espeak, and similar open-source speech phoneme concatenators),
